"Something that surprises me is how fast the role of operations research analyst is growing. It's not common to see percentages greater than 10%. I expected the data scientist role to have a greater percentage of growth, but I did not expect that from this role because I have not really heard much of it. I also am surprised that not many roles require a Master's degree. I feel like a lot of people have emphasized the importance of pursuing education past your undergrad/bachelor's, but I'm now doubting if that is very necessary. ",,,,,,

"I ranked my jobs in this order with the three most important criteria in mind being: salary, job outlook, and personal preference. My lower ranked jobs might have higher salary and job outlook, but in all honesty I would not want to work in a boring office setting with my life revolving around numbers and graphs. ",,,,,,
